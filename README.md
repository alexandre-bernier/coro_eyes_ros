## Installation

### Dependencies
    
- [CoRo Eyes SDK](https://github.com/alexandre-bernier/coro_eyes_sdk) <br />
    Follow instructions [<b>here</b>](https://github.com/alexandre-bernier/coro_eyes_sdk/blob/main/README.md).
    
- [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org/) (optional)

        pip3 install open3d

### Configurations

Before building, go to `coro_eyes_ros/config/dlp_plataforms/projector_settings.txt` and make sure that
`LCR4500_PARAMETERS_DLPC350_FIRMWARE` and `LCR4500_PARAMETERS_DLPC350_FLASH_PARAMETERS` have the right path:
`<your_catkin_ws>/src/coro_eyes_ros/config/dlp_platforms/LCr4500/[...]`.

### Building from source

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using

	cd catkin_ws/src
	git clone https://github.com/alexandre-bernier/coro_eyes_ros.git
	cd ../
	rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src
	catkin_make

## Usage

Multiple launch files are available depending on what you wish to do:

- <b>CoRo Eyes</b>

Launching this node will call the Scan node as well as the post-processing node `scripts/coro_eyes.py`.
The post-processing node listens to user inputs and calls the `coro_eyes/Scan` service. If you wish to apply any post-processing
with Open3D, you can write your own code in the `post_processing` function in `scripts/coro_eyes.py`. The processed
point cloud will be published to the `/coro_eyes/point_cloud` topic.

    roslaunch coro_eyes_ros coro_eyes.launch

Arguments:

`show_camera_feed` You can show or hide the camera feed. Default: `false`.

- <b>Scan</b>

Once everything is set up, you can launch the scan node by calling the command below. This will initialize everything
and wait for a call of `coro_eyes/Scan` service to initiate a single scan. The resulting point cloud can be recovered
either in the service call response or by subscribing to the `/coro_eyes/raw_point_cloud` topic.

    roslaunch coro_eyes_ros scan.launch

Arguments:

`show_camera_feed` You can show or hide the camera feed. Default: `false`.

- <b>Camera calibration</b>

If the cameras moved on the CoRo Eyes, it's important to re-calibrate them. Run the script with the command below and
take pictures while presenting the calibration board in as many orientation and position as possible.
The more you cover each camera's sensor with the chessboard, the better the calibration. You also need to make sure
that the chessboard is always visible by both cameras, otherwise the picture you took will be discarded.

    roslaunch coro_eyes_ros camera_calibration.launch

- <b>Adjust focus</b>

If the height of the CoRo Eyes has changed, you should make sure that the projector and the cameras are still in focus.

    roslaunch coro_eyes_ros adjust_focus.launch

- <b>Upload patterns</b>

This should only be done once or if you wish to change the projected patterns.
You most likely won't ever have to do this since patterns should already have been uploaded.
    
    roslaunch coro_eyes_ros upload_patterns.launch
